# World_Weather_Analysis

In this challenge, we will assist Jack booking a trip by using PlanMyTrip app. Since it is a new product, it is recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level and be successful. The purpose of this project is to create 2000 random coordinates (latitudes and longitudes) and retrieve weather data for the cities that belong to those coordinates. With this information, we will be able to offer our clients recommendations on possible travel destinations and the hotels in which they can stay during their vacations.
Specifically, it is recommended adding the weather description to the weather data. 
For this challenge, I used the weather description data I already retrieved in this module to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. Then, the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.

Happy Travels!
